Pentecostalism Defined

Pentecostalism is a branch of Protestant Christianity that emphasizes spiritual gifts and experiences. These spiritual gifts and experiences are often related to the
spiritual gifts and events recorded in passages such as Acts 2, 1 Corinthians 12, and 1 Corinthians 14, which include the abilities to speak in other languages, interpret
other languages, prophecy, and heal the sick.
